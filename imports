Index.ts
Typescript module resolution picks up index.ts file from folder name if it is there and try to import packages.
In this file, we can export all folder specific components and modules. For example, consider index.ts file inside products folder:
export * from './product/product.component';
export * from './products-details/products-details.component';
export * from './products-overview/products-overview.component';
export * from './products.module';


Error - Can't bind to 'formGroup' since it isn't a known property of 'form'.
